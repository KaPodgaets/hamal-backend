## Description

Created the initial C# project structure for the solution based on Clean Architecture principles. This involved creating four separate projects (`Hamal.Web`, `Hamal.Application`, `Hamal.Domain`, `Hamal.Infrastructure`) and setting up their dependencies correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A .NET solution file was created.
- Four C# projects were created: `Hamal.Web`, `Hamal.Application`, `Hamal.Domain`, `Hamal.Infrastructure`.
- Project references were configured to enforce the Clean Architecture dependency rule.
- The solution successfully compiles.
