## Description

Create the initial C# project structure for the solution based on Clean Architecture principles. This involves creating four separate projects and setting up their dependencies correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A .NET solution file exists.
- Four C# projects are created: `Hamal.Api`, `Hamal.Application`, `Hamal.Domain`, `Hamal.Infrastructure`.
- Project references are correctly configured to enforce the dependency rule (e.g., Application depends on Domain, etc.).
- The solution compiles successfully.
