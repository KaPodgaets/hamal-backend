## Description

Build the administrator-only endpoints for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting `User` accounts. This feature is essential for managing system access and validates the role-based authorization system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints for `/api/users` are implemented.
- All user management endpoints are protected by an `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` attribute.
- A non-admin user attempting to access these endpoints receives a `403 Forbidden` response.
- An admin user can successfully create, view, update, and delete other user accounts.
