## Acceptance Criteria

- Admin users can upload a CSV or XLSX file to populate the `Citizens` table.
- Admin users can export all data from the `Citizens` table into a file.
- Admin users can clear all data from the `Citizens` table.

## Definition of Done

- All child tasks are completed and their acceptance criteria are met.
