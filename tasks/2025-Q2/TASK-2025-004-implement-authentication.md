## Description

Create a secure login endpoint that issues stateless JWT access tokens. Configure the ASP.NET Core application to use this authentication scheme, validating tokens on subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A `POST /api/auth/login` endpoint exists.
- Submitting valid credentials to the login endpoint returns a valid JWT access token.
- Submitting invalid credentials returns an appropriate error (e.g., `401 Unauthorized`).
- Endpoints protected with the `[Authorize]` attribute cannot be accessed without a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header.
- No refresh token mechanism is implemented.
