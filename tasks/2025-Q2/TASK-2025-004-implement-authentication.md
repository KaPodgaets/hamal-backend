## Description

Implemented a secure login endpoint that issues stateless JWT access tokens. The ASP.NET Core application was configured to use this authentication scheme, validating tokens on subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A `POST /api/auth/login` endpoint was implemented.
- Submitting valid credentials to the login endpoint returns a valid JWT access token.
- Submitting invalid credentials returns a `401 Unauthorized` error.
- Endpoints protected with the `[Authorize]` attribute cannot be accessed without a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header.
- The system does not use refresh tokens; re-authentication is required upon token expiry.
