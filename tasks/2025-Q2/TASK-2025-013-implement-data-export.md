## Description

Implemented the `GET /api/admin/citizens/export` endpoint. This allows an administrator to download the entire current state of the `Citizens` table as a CSV file.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The endpoint was created and is protected for Admin users only.
- The endpoint returns a file download containing all records from the `Citizens` table in CSV format.
- The filename includes a timestamp to prevent browser caching issues.
